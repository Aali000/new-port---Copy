1. INTRODUCTION

The website serves as an online resume where visitors such as employers, recruiters, and clients can learn about me and contact me easily.
A key feature of the website is the Hire Me / Contact form, which is connected to a PHP backend and MySQL database using XAMPP. This allows submitted messages to be stored securely in the database for future review.
